<PDF-sandwich>

A simple script for combining PDFs. 
Embeds 'inner_pdf' between front and back pages of 'outer_pdf'.
Saves combined document at 'destination_pdf'. 

Created mostly because I don't have a printer at home,
and I don't want to get in trouble for using shared work printer
for printing personal items (concert tickets,.. etc)

Developed using:
> Python 3.5
> PyPDF2

Note to self for future development goals:
> Add simple SYS ARGS for command line use
> Consider adding a GUI for easier use and file-picking
